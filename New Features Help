I'm just posting this, in the off-chance hope that someone might want to start doing one of these features, before I
get to doing them myself.

The user interface should allow people to add a courses, by using the open file picker. 
The course should be a directory, with it's name being that of the course.

The course directory hierarchy should probably be organized like this:

CourseName
    Chapter Number
        Topic
        LessonImageFile <=== One lesson image per topic
        Problem Number <=== 1 directory per problem. Greater number of problems-per-topic == more accurate calculation of intervals.
            One Problem Image File
            Three Answer Image Files <=== One correct answeer image, two incorrect answer images.
                
Including the use of a chapter directory, allows for the course to be more easily managed for the user creating the course.


This is a fairly easy job. The class files for problems, and lessons, would only need a single line of code for the object.
The answer class file, would only need three lines of code now too. The course directory would have to be iterated through 
loops, that builds the strings of the paths as the loops run. A course name tuple should probably be added to the data base 
table template. The Course should be made the PK, and the Topic should be made the FK.

A UI should also be built to display a course library, of courses the user adds into GLIDE.

I don't mind doing these myself. But right now I'm focussing on stuff for Linux. I'll do this before the app reservation expires, 
in the Windows Store, if no one wants to do these themselves. I want to do it, but I like using Linux better, and I like C better,
so I'm building stuff in Linux right now. (Actually, I'm building my Gentoo Linux OS right now.) But I'll get back to updating this
version, so that nobody will have to compile it themselves to use it.
