# GLIDE

I made a new version of this application. This one looks nice, but it takes too long to set a course up. I will improve this one over time, so that it is better than the new version of this that I made. But, that will take a long time. This requires a lot to become better than the new version.

The new version is better for multiple reasons:

1) It is much simpler because it uses the command line, instead of the graphical user interface. I realized that this is a program which I would currently rather use in the command line, because it is quicker to make flash cards, or questions and answers, on paper, than it is to make images, or questions and answers, on the computer to work in this software.

2) The new version works on multiple operating systems. This version only works on Windows.

3) A course can be set up for the new version in a few hours. It may take weeks to set a course up for this version, which is what I realized when I decided that I want to start using it finally.

This version will get better, once I know how to make A.I.. The A.I. will make the questions and answers, or the problems and solutions-- I know that for certain. I hope to also have the A.I. generate an accurate lesson too, but I have no idea if that is feasible in the near future, for me to do anyway.

The new version that I recommend using is called GlideCLI, and it is found here: https://github.com/Dartomic/GlideCLI

Research that all calculations, are based on, except for two, can be found at https://www.ane.pl/pdf/5535.pdf

GLIDE is a program that teaches people, by implementing scientific research on learning. It's name is inspired by the teaching machine that B.F. Skinner invented, which he named "GLIDER." GLIDE is better than GLIDER, because it uses research that did not exist at the time GLIDER was invented. 

Like B.F. Skinner's GLIDER machine; GLIDE implements a Continuous Reinforcement schedule, for all of the material in which GLIDE is teaching to a respondent. Unlike GLIDER, the spacing of repetitions for the content of study sessions, is not able to be adjusted to eventually suit the needs of the respondent. The spacing system that Skinner implemented was very inefficient, even though the results were still much better than those that learning institutions still produce to this day. 

GLIDER still resulted in a Serial-Position effect. It had to. GLIDER also did not ensure, that information for a course would not decline in a respondent's retrieval ability, much lower than 95%, even if GLIDER were to be used to learn new information from, on a daily basis.

GLIDE schedules a repetition for each individual engram, to be performed when the point of retrieval for an engram on the forgetting curve, decays to 95%. Difficulty is calculated for each engram, to be used for the calculation of retrieval. This results in a mix of information to perform repetitions on in a study session, and does not usually, if ever, result in a the Serial-Position effect's dip, after the second day of study for a new course. Skinner did not have the spacing calculations that GLIDE implements, which have been available now for a while. 


Comparison of GLIDE vs GLIDER:

GLIDER
1. GLIDER was an expensive machine. 
2. It used Continuous Reinforcement, without implementing Punishment which may cause aversion to it's use. 
3. It was difficult to install a course into it. 
4. GLIDER did not base the spacing schedule on a mathematical model.
5. The Serial-Position effect was not avoidable with GLIDER's use.
6. The memory of a learned course would decay once complete. 

GLIDE
1. GLIDE is completely free software. 
2. It uses Continuous Reinforcement, without implementing Punishment which may cause aversion to it's use. 
3. It is simple to install a course onto it. 
4. GLIDE does base the spacing schedule on a mathematical model, which is backed by scientific research to efficiently schedule the spacing of repetitions, per engram.
5. Hypothetically; the Serial-Position effect stops occuring, soon after a new course is started.
6. The memory of a learned course will not decay once a course is complete, but only if GLIDE is still used, which would probably be to learn new courses.



Users can add their textbooks, into GLIDE. The questions, or problems, need to be as direct as possible. The lessons need to only contain a page number of a text book, or the chapter and section (such as "11.6").


See https://github.com/Dartomic/GLIDE/blob/master/warnings.md for some issues that users currently need to be aware of. Some updates are coming up soon, which will make these issues disapear. The only real issue you need to be aware of, is that you should back up the database file for now. 


My main goal, was to have this application ready for ME to use, and I love sharing.
