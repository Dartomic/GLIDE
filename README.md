# GLIDE
GLIDE is a program that teaches people, by implementing scientific research on learning. It's name is inspired by the teaching machine that B.F. Skinner invented, which he named "GLIDER." GLIDE is better than GLIDER, because it uses research that did not exist at the time GLIDER was invented.
